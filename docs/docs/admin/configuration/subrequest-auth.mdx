title: Subrequest Authentication

Anubis can act in one of two modes:

1. Reverse proxy (the default): Anubis sits in the middle of all traffic and then will reverse proxy it to its destination. This is the moral equivalent of a middleware in your favorite web framework.
2. Subrequest authentication mode: Anubis listens for requests and if they don't pass muster then they are forwarded to Anubis for challenge processing. This is the equivalent of Anubis being a sidecar service.

## Nginx

Anubis can perform [subrequest authentication](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/) with the `auth_request` module in Nginx. In order to set this up, keep the following things in mind:

The `TARGET` environment variable in Anubis must be set to a space, eg:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="env-file" label="Environment file" default>

```shell
# anubis.env

TARGET=" "
# ...
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

```yaml
services:
  anubis-nginx:
    image: ghcr.io/techarohq/anubis:latest
    environment:
      TARGET: " "
      # ...
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

Inside your Deployment, StatefulSet, or Pod:

```yaml
- name: anubis
  image: ghcr.io/techarohq/anubis:latest
  env:
    - name: TARGET
      value: " "
    # ...
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In order to configure this, you need to add the following location blocks to each server pointing to the service you want to protect:

```nginx
location /.within.website/ {
    # Assumption: Anubis is running in the same network namespace as
    # nginx on localhost TCP port 8923
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8923;
    auth_request off;
}

location @redirectToAnubis {
    return 307 /.within.website/?redir=$scheme://$host$request_uri;
    auth_request off;
}
```

This sets up `/.within.website` to point to Anubis. Any requests that Anubis rejects or throws a challenge to will be sent here. This also sets up a named location `@redirectToAnubis` that will redirect any requests to Anubis for advanced processing.

Finally, add this to your root location block:

```nginx
location / {
    # diff-add
    auth_request /.within.website/x/cmd/anubis/api/check;
    # diff-add
    error_page 401 = @redirectToAnubis;
}
```

This will check all requests that don't match other locations with Anubis to ensure the client is genuine.

This will make every request get checked by Anubis before it hits your backend. If you have other locations that don't need Anubis to do validation, add the `auth_request off` directive to their blocks:

```nginx
location /secret {
    # diff-add
    auth_request off;

    # ...
}
```

Here is a complete example of an Nginx server listening over TLS and pointing to Anubis:

```nginx

  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

  location /.within.website/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8923;
    auth_request off;
  }

  location @redirectToAnubis {
    return 307 /.within.website/?redir=$scheme://$host$request_uri;
    auth_request off;
  }

  location / {
    auth_request /.within.website/x/cmd/anubis/api/check;
    error_page 401 = @redirectToAnubis;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
  }
}
```
