## v1.14.0

> Fail to do as my lord commands...and I will spare him the trouble of blocking you.

- Add explanation of what Anubis is doing to the challenge page [#25](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/25)
- Administrators can now define artificially hard challenges using the "slow" algorithm:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "generic-bot-catchall",
    "user_agent_regex": "(?i:bot|crawler)",
    "action": "CHALLENGE",
    "challenge": {
      "difficulty": 16,
      "report_as": 4,
      "algorithm": "slow"
    }
  }
  ```

  This allows administrators to cause particularly malicious clients to use unreasonable amounts of CPU. The UI will also lie to the client about the difficulty.

- Docker images now explicitly call `docker.io/library/<thing>` to increase compatibility with Podman et. al
  [#21](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/21)
- Don't overflow the image when browser windows are small (eg. on phones)
  [#27](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/27)
- Lower the default difficulty to 4 from 5
- Don't duplicate work across multiple threads [#36](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/36)
- Documentation has been moved to https://anubis.techaro.lol/ with sources in docs/
- Removed several visible AI artifacts (e.g., 6 fingers) [#37](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/37)
- [KagiBot](https://kagi.com/bot) is allowed through the filter [#44](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/44)
- Fixed hang when navigator.hardwareConcurrency is undefined
- Support Unix domain sockets [#45](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/45)
- Allow filtering by remote addresses:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "qwantbot",
    "user_agent_regex": "\\+https\\:\\/\\/help\\.qwant\\.com/bot/",
    "action": "ALLOW",
    "remote_addresses": ["91.242.162.0/24"]
  }
  ```

  This also works at an IP range level:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "internal-network",
    "action": "ALLOW",
    "remote_addresses": ["100.64.0.0/10"]
  }
  ```

- The README now points to TecharoHQ/anubis instead of Xe/x
- Images are built using ko instead of `docker buildx build`
  [#13](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/13)

## 1.12.1

  something more suitable for general consumption
  ([fd6903a](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/commit/fd6903aeed315b8fddee32890d7458a9271e4798)).
